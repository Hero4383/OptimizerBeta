Setup:

  - Optimizer repo (private) - contains source code
  - OptimizerBeta repo (public) - contains installer for beta testers
  - Beta testers get unique keys that work only once

  Solution: GitHub Release with Token Authentication

  Step 1: Create Release in Private Optimizer Repo

  1. Build your JAR: optimizer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
  2. Create release in private Optimizer repo
  3. Upload JAR as release asset

  Step 2: Generate Fine-Grained Token

  - Repository: Hero4383/Optimizer (private repo)
  - Permissions: Contents: Read only
  - Expiration: Set based on beta testing period

  Step 3: Updated Installer (.bat file)

  set "GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  set "DOWNLOAD_URL=https://api.github.com/repos/Hero4383/Optimizer/release
  s/latest/assets"

  The installer will:
  1. Use token to access private repo releases
  2. Download the JAR from the latest release
  3. Install it to RuneLite plugins folder

  Step 4: Beta Key System

  For one-time use keys, you'd need:
  - Server endpoint that validates keys
  - Each key can only download once
  - Installer checks key before downloading

  Would you like me to create this updated installer with token
  authentication?
